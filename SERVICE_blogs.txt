Carpet cleaning services in Brisbane – Ipswich – Gold & Sunshine Coast – fast drying – Quality Service
Professional, quality carpet cleaning service in Brisbane, Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast at the right price. We know the safest and most effective way to clean your carpet is through a Deep Steam Clean or Dry Clean.

Best 1 will Deep Steam or Dry Clean your Carpet to the highest standard as it is the only way to clean carpets! We take pride in our work and have worked hard to make your cleaning experience as easy and pleasant as possible.

No more wet carpets for days, not with Best 1! Our Truck Mounted Steam cleaning machines are the best in the business, with the latest last step injection process. We take out all of the cleaning agents used to clean your carpets/rug/upholstery.

To begin, the Best 1 team can do a pre-vacuum of the carpet. Then, unlike other cleaning companies, Best 1 will do a pre-stain treatment of the whole carpet area rather than spot cleaning. Spot cleaning is ineffective in the sense that it often leaves the treated areas looking cleaner than the rest of the carpet, creating an uneven look.

With real estate agents becoming more and more fussy on condition reports when tenants are vacating a rental property, it pays to use an industry leader in this type of cleaning. We have been doing vacate cleans for 15 years now and know exactly what your agents wants. The good thing is we are fully licensed and know what your agent requires to be sure you get your bond back with no problems. That’s why we stand by our cleans and offer you a 100% guarantee.

After the stain treatment, the carpet is given a thorough Deep Steam Clean (NOT just hot water!) using our state of the art machines. The Best 1 team uses our up to date cleaning products to remove lasting dirt from within the carpet.

Our machine pressure ranges from 250-3000 psi; this varies depending on the carpet type, state and condition.  Your carpets will be left free of any cleaning products and residues. It’s the safest and most hygienic way to leave your carpets. Our final process is to deodorise and neutralise your carpets to leave them with a long lasting freshness.

Why not protect your carpets/rugs/upholstery after you have fully cleaned it by having the Best 1 Team apply a carpet protection to all your carpets & upholstery?

There are so many different types of fabric protection these days for carpets/upholstery. We have products that can be applied after the cleaning process is completed. But now we have new products that can be applied whilst cleaning. That’s right, we can use the fabric protection solution as a cleaning agent.

The way it works is the product has a two-step process. As we are extracting the cleaning part of the solution, a residual part is left in the fabric and it is this that helps to protect the fabric just the same as if it was applied after the clean. It is very popular with our upholstery cleans as it saves time and money, making it a more affordable way of protecting your carpets/rugs/upholstery. That’s right, it can be used on all fabrics. This is why Best 1 keeps up to date on all the latest techniques and product available.

Best 1 takes enormous pride in our work and believes our value is simply unbeatable! Why over pay for quality? Based on our years of experience and repeat business, our clients obviously think so too.
Safe , we guarantee it
Our processes, equipment and products have been tried and tested for premium results and customer satisfaction. We operate with state of the art truck mount & portable machines and encourage our customers to take a look.

We have a large range of clients from homeowners, rental move outs, high rise apartments and commercial premises.

Best 1 has it covered. The reason we can offer a full guarantee on our work is that we have the best machines available on the market today. We also want your repeat business and for you to recommend us to your family and friends. This is why best 1 invest in the best.

 Steam Cleaned or Dry Cleaned
There are all sorts of makes and styles of carpets in manufacture today. This is why you should use a trusted company like Best 1. We are industry leaders in keeping up to date with new technology and techniques in the carpet cleaning industry and also in the carpet manufacturing industry.

It is important to keep up with this so we can provide the best service to our customers. There is more to cleaning carpets than meets the eye. You need to know what products you can and can’t put onto certain types of carpets.

For instance, there are some carpet fibres you should not put solvent base cleaning products on, as this can lead to the backing of the carpet to pull away. Over time, the solvents in the products can deteriorate the way the fibre is attached to the backing, which will result in bare patches over time.

This is why we keep our technicians up to date and go on refresher courses that are held yearly for carpet cleaners. It helps us maintain a high level of cleaning in our business.

There are also new cleaning products that come onto the market each month, and Best 1 gets to try these out giving us first hand knowledge on how well they perform.

We are also trained to understand what sort of stains are permanent and know which fabrics certain stains will come out of.  Some of our customers are asthmatics, and we need to understand the products that we can use in this case so not to give any distress to our customers. These all comes from years of experience and constant research and training.

Some people ask me what is the best sort of clean: a steam clean or a dry clean? For me, it will always be a steam clean, but the new dry cleaning techniques are fast becoming popular with the carpet cleaning industry.

The new type of dry cleaning is now called Encapsulation cleaning. This sort of cleaning process can be very effective if done correctly and used in the correct situation. Our friends at power clean industries first showed us the correct way to apply an Encapsulation clean and we now use it for various cleaning jobs. This is also used in our Gold cleaning service. You can learn more about this in our Gold clean section of the website.

Environmentally Friendly.
It is recommended that your carpets & upholstery be cleaned at least every 12 months to keep them hygienically clean.

Best 1 keeps up to date with the way the different products change from month to month, so that we can use the best products on the market in your home.

Best 1 is in touch with our suppliers on a regular basis to ensure we have the right treatments for your carpets. We like to use environmentally friendly products as they are safe for you the customer and also for us the cleaner.

UPHOLSTERY CLEANING
  
Best 1 Upholstery Cleaning – Couch Cleaning – Sofa Bed Cleaning
To clean upholstery/lounge suites, the Best 1 professional team uses a similar process to that of carpet cleaning. Your lounge suites will be left clean, soft and ready to sit on once more.  The results will amaze you!

To begin, the Best 1 team can do a pre-vacuum of the seats. Then, unlike other cleaning companies, Best 1 will do a pre-stain treatment of the whole seats first, rather than just a spot clean.

Spot cleaning is ineffective in the sense that it often leaves the treated areas looking cleaner than the rest of the seats, creating an uneven look. A test is done on the reverse side of your upholstery to ensure no running or fading will occur on the fabric.

After the stain treatment, the upholstery/lounge suite is given a thorough Deep Steam Clean (NOT just hot water!). Best 1 have a special upholstery tool – these smaller wands are used to clean lounge suites to ensure the up most care is taken when cleaning your furniture.

Our state of the art upholstery tool ensures we can’t over wet your fabric. The tool is designed in such a way that there is no over spray of steam, ensuring all excess water is sucked up into the machine. This in important on upholstery because over wetting can cause water marks to appear. These sort of marks are hard to remove even for a professional cleaner. We also reduce the risk of over wetting by using our state of the art machines.

The Best 1 team uses our up to date products to remove lasting dirt & oils from within the seats. Your seats will be left free of any cleaning products and residues. It’s the safest and most hygienic way to leave your upholstery/lounge suites.

Our final process is to Deodorise and Neutralise. Your upholstery to leave them with a long lasting freshness.

It is recommended that your upholstered furniture be cleaned at least every 12 months to keep the furniture hygienically clean.
Upholstery furniture is one of the most expensive items in our homes. It is the Best 1 team’s years of experience that lets them know how to look after and clean your furniture. Whether you just want a freshen-up or thinking of throwing out the old lounge, give us a call. You’ll be amazed at how well your lounges will look after we have finished with them!

The Best 1 upholstery cleaning will treat all Cotton, Velvet, Indian Cotton, Micro Suede, Wool and many more common fabrics.  We also clean all Leather Suites as well!

Why not protect your furniture after you have fully cleaned it – by having the Best 1 Team apply a fabric protection to your lounge suite.

LEATHER SEAT CLEANING
  
Best 1 Leather Seat Cleaning Methods
At Best 1 Cleaning we use the most thorough and effective cleaning techniques for everything we clean, including leather.

Looks and Life
To maintain the looks and ensure the durability of your leather products, they should be regularly cleaned and conditioned. This is particularly true for high cost, high value items such as leather furniture, which should be professionally cleaned at least once every 12 months. Cleaning leather is best done properly by hand, and by a trained professional cleaner.

The Best 1 Way
Some companies use electric spinning brushes to clean leather. But we at Best 1 Cleaning feels that this can result in damage to the surface of the leather: particularly if the spinning brushes are left in contact with the surface for too long. Therefore, we use purely manual methods. We carry out a routine pre-vacuum of the leather item and then massage the leather cleaning solution into the leather with a soft brush, thus ensuring that the solution penetrates into all of the creases and lines in the leather. Next, we massage the leather surface with white towels to absorb the cleaning solution, before giving a final massage with another white towel to buff the leather.

A Long Life Solution
The cleaning solution that Best 1 Cleaning Brisbane use is also a conditioner, which helps to keep the leather soft and to prevent cracking over time. To give you the Best 1 Cleaning ultra solution, we can apply a second coat and leave part of solution/conditioner in the leather for long-term protection.

Use the Professionals
Our Best 1 professional cleaners give your leather items a great clean, and can also give you tips on how to maintain the items in good condition.

Mould on Carpets
in General /
[separator top=”-55″ bottom=”10″ style=””]
Mould can be a big problem if left on carpets for too long as the mould spores can permanently stain the fibres leaving unsightly marks over the surface of the carpet.

Not only can a permanent mark be left, but also ill health from the mould, it can bring on asthma attacks in asthmatics. So it best to remove all traces of mould as soon as possible.

Calling a Carpet Cleaning Professional for Mould Removal
The most effective way to remove mould would be to call a trained professional carpet cleaner. With the aid of steam and a selection of cleaning solutions the mould can be taken out of the carpet, before any further damage is caused.

The surface mould, if already formed a covering over the affected area would be extracted with a steam cleaning machine, after this the area is treated with a specialised cleaning solution this will remove the rest of the mould from the affected area.

After the cleaning process the area should be left as dry as possible. To do this, a quality carpet cleaning company is required with well-maintained equipment, this will help to prevent the mould from reforming. Then the area is treated with a mould inhibitor, this is left in the carpet to dry.

After the cleaning process and the application of the mould inhibitor and some deodoriser, the area should be left to completely dry and no furniture should be place back there until dry.

Bacteria and Odour
Mould can affect carpets after they have been subject to excessive water, this can occur from rain water which can carry all sorts of bacteria and leave odours in the carpet, or when a water pipe has burst or a washing machine outlet pipe has become blocked. In any of these circumstances the water can be extracted and the area treated if done by a trained professional.

Mould can also leave carpets smelly and making the affected area almost unbearable to be around, in some cases where the affected area has been left to long with the mould on it, the backing of the carpet can also start to grow mould, at this point a full assessment of the carpet need to be done to see if the carpet can be saved. This is where a well trained professional carpet cleaner would be able to explain the best possible way to solve the problem.

Rug cleaning

Call us today! (07) 3245 5126 |  info@best1cleaning.com
Best 1 Cleaning and Pest Control
Rug Cleaning
in General /
[separator top=”-55″ bottom=”10″ style=””]
When choosing a rug cleaning company make sure you choose a professional, with experience in cleaning all types of different rugs, from Persians to Orientals, wool and synthetic.

A rug cleaning company with state of the art steam cleaning machines and techniques is important so you get the most out of your valuable rug for years to come.

Onsite Rug Cleaning
To clean a rug on site at a customer’s home requires a fully trained technician, the fibres of the rug need to be identified before applying any cleaning solutions, Fibre identification is an important process this ensures the correct cleaning product for the type of rug to be cleaned are used. This is done by doing a test piece on the rug first in an inconspicuous place to be sure no damage can be caused.

A good deep vacuum of with a power head vacuum cleaner is best to get deep down into the base of the rug, this will release the dust and grit before the cleaning process. Releasing the dust and grit will prolong the life of the rug, this grit can act like sand paper when walked on and do damage to the fibres at the base of the rug, this can cause fibres to detach and over time leave bare patches.
After the vacuum and steam clean is done, this will clean each fibre of the rug if done properly and make the rug feel and look clean again.

When a rug cleaning company comes to collect a rug, and take it away to be cleaned at a specially designed rug washing facility. Then a different cleaning process is done, the main cleaning is still done with steam cleaning, but there are a few steps before this. The rug would be hung inside the cleaning room, then compressed air is used to blow out the dust and grit from within the fibres, this is the most effective way to release the in ground dust particulates.

Power Vacuum
Then a thorough power head vacuum is done over the rug to ensure it’s completely free from any dust and grit, then the rug is deep steam cleaned this process will not only clean the rug but will also kill any bacteria within the fibres, leaving just the natural feel  and look of the rug. The rug is then hung in the drying room to dry naturally, then a final inspection and deodorise is done to give the best possible results.

Fabric Protection
Also a protective coating, called a fabric protection can be applied to the rug after the cleaning process; this will help to prevent little accidents, with spills from drinks or if a cat or dog urinates on the rug, urine is one of the hardest smells to get rid of in any fabric and has to be handled by a professional using special antibacterial solutions and neutralisers for a successful outcome. The fabric protection will also help protect the fibres from wear and tear prolonging the life of the rug.

FLOOD WATER EXTRACTION

Flood Damaged Carpets – Water Extraction – Wet Carpets
Here at Best 1 Carpet Cleaning in Brisbane Queensland, our technicians are fully trained to handle any flood damage situation.

Flooding can occur through many different ways, such as Washing machine overflow, Bath tub overflow, Sink overflow, Hot water system breakdown, Air conditioners, Burst water pipes, and runoff of rain or storm water & even Roof leaks.

When you have wet carpets, you need to have the water extracted as soon as possible or permanent damage can be caused. No job is too hard for the Best 1 Carpet Restoration Flood Damage team. Call us today for a free, no obligation, over the telephone quote.

The best way to extract water from carpets is to use a High Powered Truck Mounted cleaning system; this ensures the carpets dry as fast as possible. Best 1 then uses air movers to help the drying process.

Best 1 also deodorises and sanitises and neutralises the affected carpets, as part of our cleaning and drying process. Because we use state of the art Truck Mounted Machines with real STEAM, we can kill the bacteria in the carpet. Steam is the only way to go with this sort of problem.

The faster  we can get to treat a flooded carpet the better it is because if the affected area is left to long  you can be left with water marks, and these types of marks can be very hard to remove from the carpet.

We can use a browning treatment that can be applied to the carpet after the flood damaged area has been thoroughly cleaned. This can reduce the risk of browning in the carpet. With some water damaged carpets, the underlay may have to be replace. Best 1 can access this before starting the job, saving you money and time.

Our Truck Mounted cleaning systems have an auto pump out, meaning we can just keep cleaning and the machine will get rid of the waste automatically. The process allows us to finish the job faster and you to save money.

Storm Season
Storm Season is already upon us. These storms do not only destroy the outside of your property, they can also cause major damage to your internal carpets, upholstery and rugs. You can trust Best 1 Carpet Cleaning to restore your valuable items back to their original state before the dreaded storms got to them.

COMMERCIAL CARPET CLEANING
  
Commercial Carpet Cleaning
Here at Best 1 Carpet Cleaning in Brisbane we are experts in cleaning commercial carpets.

Because commercial carpets need a more powerful clean, Best 1 uses TRUCK MOUNTED cleaning systems.

Best 1’s truck mounted machines are so powerful that they can be up to 250 meters away from the job site. So, when you are booking a carpet cleaning job in Brisbane, Ipswich, Gold Coast or Sunshine Coast, always confirm that the company can offer a TRUCK MOUNTED cleaning system where possible.

We can combine this powerful system with Best 1’s encapsulation low moisture cleaning process (ENCAP) to leave your carpets with the best ultra clean results.

Best 1 guarantees that when we do this type of clean, there is nothing that comes close to it, a claim that is based on Best 1’s 15 years of experience.

Best 1’s cleaning procedures remove odours from your carpets or seats and leave your carpets walk on dry.

To have one of our trained technicians come to you commercial premises, just give Best 1 Carpet Cleaners a call today. Don’t forget – Call the Rest then Call the Best 1.

Most commercial grade carpets fitted in industrial buildings, such as shops, schools, warehouses and office blocks, are good for carpet cleaners to clean, as we can use most cleaning agents on them without risk of damage to the carpet fibres.

However, in some schools and shops, there can be a lot of gum or other sticky substances stuck to the carpets, and solvents may be needed to remove them. Unfortunately solvents, if not handled correctly and properly extracted, can gradually eat out the backing of the carpets.

This is where Best 1 Cleaning can be trusted to do a quality job, with no risk to your carpet fibres. Our carpet-cleaning technicians know how to handle solvents. We also use our Last Step Injection® process to flush out all the solvents and cleaning agents used to clean the carpets, thus ensuring that you get the best cleaning results.

Vacating a Rental? Looking for Bond Cleaning
0 Comments/in Cleaning, Video /
I’ve done blog’s on this topic a few times, but it’s a question that keeps popping up when we are talking to customers on the phone.

The main thing we get asked is when to have the carpets cleaned when vacating a rental property and the other big question is do we guarantee our work.

The answer to these questions are in my latest video in the link above, but if you prefer I’ll explain it here now.

Ok so when should you have your carpets steam or dry cleaned during the process of vacating a rental property that you have to hand back to your realestate agent.

The simple fast answer to this is at the very end, the carpet cleaner should be the last person in your property, so this is when all the other cleaning has been completed, such as the general bond cleaning, this includes kitchens, bathrooms, walls, windows etc.

You need to make sure that the house or unit is ready for another tenant or your agent will simply hold part or your entire bond in order to fix up any problems that they are not happy with.

So make sure the carpeted area’s being cleaned are empty and pre-vacuumed before your carpet cleaner arrives, this will ensure a Hassall free exit clean of your property, and after the carpets have been done no one should walk on them again until your property manager has been in to do their final inspection.

Now as far as a guarantee goes all cleaning that has been done should come with some sort of a warranty, this will help you in getting your bond back fast and Hassall free.

Our guarantee is in place for one week on all carpet cleaning for empty properties, this allows sufficient time for the agent to inspect the property and past it off and have your bond released.

The idea of using a reputable company that guarantee’s there work when vacating a rental, is that it gives you peace of mind knowing that if there are any problems brought up during the inspection process you are covered and have the help there to sort out and fix any issues.

Realestate agents are very fussy when it comes to hand over of keys at the end of a tenancy, so be sure to use a reputable cleaning company like Best 1 cleaning and pest control to help you with your cleaning needs.

Best 1 Cleaning and Pest Control
ENCAPSULATION LOW MOISTURE CLEANING
  
WHAT IS ENCAPSULATION?
Encapsulation is a carpet and upholstery cleaning process that uses new cleaning products that wraps up or encapsulates the soil and detergent residue, allowing for it to be easily removed by dry vacuuming.

WHAT EQUIPMENT IS USED
At Best 1 carpet cleaning in Brisbane the machine we use is the Truvox Orbis.

For encapsulation cleaning to be effective, the technician doing the clean should be experienced in this type of cleaning process. With this Carpet dry cleaning method, the carpets are walk on dry.

BEST 1 ENCAP CLEANING PROCESS
The greenest carpet cleaning method available
Gives great results
Competitively priced
Fast drying
What is Best 1 ENCAP dry cleaning?

ENCAP = Encapsulation. During the Best 1 ENCAP carpet and upholstery cleaning process, rotary scrubbers are used to very effectively permeate the soiled surface with a special cleaning solution that totally wraps up (encapsulates) the soil and the detergent residue. The residue is removed by vacuuming.


THE STEPS IN THE ENCAP CLEANING PROCESS.
Dry vacuum the carpet or upholstery. as 85% of soil in the average carpet is dry soil and is removed with this initial vacuum.
Treat any stubborn stains with spotters.
Apply the cleaning solution to the carpet or upholstery to remove most common stains.
Run the rotary scrubber over the carpet or upholstery until all stains are removed.
Dry vacuum the carpet or upholstery to remove the encapsulated soil.
Rake the carpets or brush the upholstery, to give a good appearance and to stand the fibres upright.
This type of cleaning is extremely effective when done by one of our professional cleaners. It can be used on residential and commercial carpets, upholstery or rugs; and on car seats.

Lounge Suites. If you have a lounge suit that states that it is not to be steam cleaned or cleaned using a hot water extraction method, then this cleaning process is the one for you.

Woollen Carpets. This is an ideal method for cleaning the natural fibres in woolen carpets.

Smells. There are no residual smells from this cleaning method.

Encapsulation cleaning is used in hotels, restaurants, motels and function rooms.

If you would like more information on this cleaning process just give Best 1 Carpet Cleaning a call.

Mattress Cleaning

Best 1 will make your mattress look and feel like new again. Most people overlook the importance of steam cleaning a mattress. Just like carpets and upholstery the mattress is made up of fibres.

Within these fibres can live all sort of things, such as bedbugs, plus the dead skin from our bodies that remains in the mattress. Without a deep steam clean, you can’t get it out.

There are two ways of cleaning mattresses: an ultra violet light or a steam clean.  Here at Best 1 Cleaning, we prefer the steam cleaning method.  With a steam clean, we get right down deep into the fibres of the mattress, extracting all the dead skin and bacteria that live there.

Those that suffer from allergies, such as asthma or dust related allergies, would find the process of a deep steam clean on a mattress very beneficial.

Our pre-vacuum takes out 65% of dust particulates, which can cause damage to the fibres and reducing the life of a mattress. So care and regular vacuuming is the best way to look after your mattress. Some of these mattresses cost a lot of money these days, so look after them. Do a vacuum of your mattress every 1-2 months.

1. Best 1 does an inspection of the mattress to look for any stains that may need to be treated before the cleaning process.

2. We then do a pre-vacuum using our hospital grade filters

3. Then we apply a cleaning solution. This helps to lift stubborn stains.

4. Then we do a deep steam clean, getting deep down to base fibres for a thorough clean.

5. We would then treat the mattress with a sanitising solution. This will eliminate any bacteria within the mattress fibres.

6. Then a final deodorising, this leaves the mattress feeling fresh and clean.

After a steam clean of a mattress, the drying time is around 1-2 hours and can be used the same day.  We can get these dry time because of the powerful Truck Mounted machines we use. Our machines get up to 140 degrees. This will eliminate any bedbugs or bacteria you may have in the mattress.

Duo Carpet Cleaning System for High Rise Apartments

Call us today! (07) 3245 5126 |  info@best1cleaning.com
Best 1 Cleaning and Pest Control
DUO CARPET CLEANING SYSTEM FOR HIGH RISE APARTMENTS
  
Best 1 Cleaning has a range of different services and one of our new services.
We offer to our customers who live in high rise apartments our Duo Clean. This is a combination of our low moisture fusion cleaning and hot water extraction cleaning.

If you live in a high rise apartment and you’re sick of carpet cleaners doing a hot water extraction carpet clean and leaving the stains in the carpet and also the carpets wet for days, it’s time to change to our Duo cleaning system.

The Best 1 carpet cleaning professionals in Brisbane have developed a cleaning technique like no other. We first do a thorough pre vacuum of all the carpeted areas, including the edges; this is something most carpet cleaners don’t do.

We then do a spot clean on any stubborn stains that may be in the carpet, then we do our low moisture fusion clean. This is a cleaning process that uses specialised cleaning solutions combined with chemistry to do the cleaning. It will not only clean and remove stains, but also agitate the carpet fibres as we clean, giving a thorough clean to all sides of each fibre.

Once we have agitated the carpet fibres and removed most of the stains, we then go over the whole carpet again with the hot water extraction unit. This process will rinse the carpet thoroughly and also deodorise and sanitise as we clean.

After the two step cleaning process has finished, we then do a final clean with a super absorbent pad that is attached to our rotary spinning machine. This will not only leave the carpet drier but will also act as a final buff over the surface of the carpet, leaving it feeling better than ever before.

One of the important things to understand with this type of cleaning process is we only use low pressure when doing the hot water extraction, not high pressure like other companies. The higher the pressure is set on the machine the wetter the carpets will be left when using a portable extraction unit. This is because portable machines just don’t have the suction needed to leave the carpets dry like a truck mounted machine does.

Because we do our low moisture fusion clean prior to the hot water extraction, the carpets are clean so less pressure is needed. This is the key factor in us not over wetting your carpets and leaving them wet for days.

There is no other carpet cleaning company that spends the time and effort that we do when cleaning carpets. Our Duo clean is mainly targeted at our customers who live in high rise building where we can’t use our truck mounted steam cleaning machine.

Here at Best 1 Cleaning, we have spent a lot of time working with our suppliers to come up with a cleaning solution that offers a high level of cleaning where a truck mounted machine can’t get to. So don’t put up with wet soggy carpets that look no different after the cleaning process, choose the Duo clean from Best 1 Cleaning the leaders in carpet cleaning.

Our Duo clean is great for carpet cleaning in Brisbane, Ipswich, Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast where there are a lot of high rise residential and commercial properties.
